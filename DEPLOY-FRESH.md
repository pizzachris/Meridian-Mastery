# Fresh Netlify Deployment

## Step 1: Delete Old Netlify Site
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com/teams/YOUR_TEAM/sites
2. Find the old "startling-chebakia-0ca7da" site
3. Click on it → Site settings → General → Delete site

## Step 2: Create New Site
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com
2. Click "Add new site" → "Deploy manually"
3. Drag the `dist` folder from your computer
4. Wait for deployment to complete

## Step 3: Your Files Are Ready
The `dist` folder contains everything needed:
- index.html (your React app)
- CSS and JS bundles
- PWA manifest and service worker

## Alternative: Use This ZIP
I'll create a deployment.zip file you can upload directly.
