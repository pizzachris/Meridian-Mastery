# Meridian Mastery React App: Chat Session Summary and Context

## 1. Project Overview
- **Goal:** Ensure all body model images (desktop and mobile) and point overlays are perfectly aligned in the React app, with correct JSON/image pairing and no image resizing. Support meridian-specific images and JSONs, especially for Lung, and allow for arbitrary image sizes.
- **Recent Focus:** Add and structure mobile JSONs for each meridian, use new Lung meridian images (desktop and mobile), update JSONs with new points and region polygons, and ensure overlays are pixel-perfect.

## 2. Technical Foundation
- **Frontend:** React (function components, hooks)
- **Assets:** Static images in `public/improved_body_map_with_regions/improved_body_models_and_regions/` and `public/improved/`
- **JSON Data:** Meridian JSONs (e.g., `lung_meridian_with_regions.json`, `lung_meridian_mobile.json`)
- **Main Component:** `src/components/BodyMapInteractiveNew.jsx`
- **CSS:** `.image-container`, `.meridian-image` for native image rendering

## 3. Key Code Logic (BodyMapInteractiveNew.jsx)
- **Image Sizing:** Always uses the image's natural size for overlays and points, supporting arbitrary image sizes.
- **Image Path Logic:**
  - For Lung, on mobile front view: `/improved/Lung_Meridian_Mobile.png`
  - For Lung, on desktop front view: `/improved/Lung_Meridian.png`
  - For other meridians: uses standard images in `/improved_body_map_with_regions/improved_body_models_and_regions/`
- **JSON Loading:** Loads points and regions from the correct JSON for each meridian and view.
- **Overlay Logic:** Points and regions are rendered using the image's true pixel dimensions, with overlays starting at (0,0).
- **Flashcard Controls:** Always visible in zoomed view.

## 4. Recent Operations
- Updated `getCurrentImagePath` to use the new Lung mobile image for Lung on mobile front view.
- Updated `lung_meridian_mobile.json` with new point coordinates and a new region polygon.
- Ensured overlays and points use the image's natural size for all meridians.
- Restored flashcard controls in zoomed view.
- Force pushed all changes to the main branch.

## 5. Outstanding Issues
- If the new Lung mobile image is not showing, ensure the file `/public/improved/Lung_Meridian_Mobile.png` exists and is not cached by the browser.
- All code and JSON logic is now set up to support arbitrary image sizes and meridian-specific images for both desktop and mobile.

## 6. How to Continue
- To add or update a meridian, place the new image in `/public/improved/` and update the corresponding JSON in `/public/improved/`.
- The main logic for image and overlay rendering is in `src/components/BodyMapInteractiveNew.jsx`.
- For new meridian images, update the `getCurrentImagePath` function as needed.
- For new points or regions, update the relevant JSON file.

## 7. Next Steps
- If you need to add more meridian images or update JSONs, follow the established pattern.
- If overlays are not aligning, check the image file, JSON coordinates, and ensure the image is not being resized in CSS or JS.
