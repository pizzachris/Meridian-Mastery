# Conversation Summary

TASK DESCRIPTION:
Improve the interactive body map React component for a meridian/pressure point learning app. Key goals: 
- Remove polylines/lines between points, use only small elemental-colored points.
- Ensure points align perfectly with the body image on all screen sizes/aspect ratios.
- Only render the small point marker (no double circles).
- Fix mobile/desktop touch and scroll behavior so the page scrolls normally unless a meridian is selected.
- In zoom/flashcard view, show the selected point as a highlighted marker on the body image.
- Fix HT9 popup so that after closing, the flashcard for HT9 is shown if it is the selected point.

COMPLETED:
- Systematic code review of BodyMapInteractiveNew.jsx for bugs and anti-patterns.
- Removed polyline/meridian line drawing; only elemental-colored points are shown.
- All points now use a single, small, consistent size.
- Improved point alignment by using the image’s natural pixel dimensions and actual rendered size for scaling.
- Ensured the image always maintains its aspect ratio and points align on all screens.
- Removed the outer/larger circle, leaving only the small colored point.
- Fixed mobile scroll: page scrolls normally unless a meridian is selected (then pan/zoom is enabled).
- Fixed desktop zoom: pan/zoom only enabled when a meridian is selected.
- Fixed HT9 popup: after closing, if HT9 is the selected point, the flashcard is shown.
- In zoom/flashcard view, the selected point is now shown as a highlighted marker (larger, yellow, glowing circle) on the body image.
- All changes have been committed and force pushed to the repository after each major update.

PENDING:
- No major tasks pending; all user requests and bugs described so far have been addressed.
- Awaiting further user feedback or new issues.
