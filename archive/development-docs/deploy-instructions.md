# Deployment Instructions for Meridian Mastery

## Current Status
- ✅ Local build works correctly (`npm run build` successful)
- ✅ Local preview works at http://localhost:3000
- ❌ Netlify deployment shows blank page (outdated build)

## To Fix the Netlify Deployment

### Option 1: Netlify Drag & Drop (Recommended)
1. Open https://app.netlify.com/sites/startling-chebakia-0ca7da/deploys
2. Drag and drop the entire `dist` folder from:
   `c:\Users\pizza\Desktop\meridian master GPT 2nd attempt\dist`
3. Wait for deployment to complete

### Option 2: Netlify CLI
```powershell
# Install Netlify CLI if not already installed
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Login to Netlify
netlify login

# Deploy the dist folder
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist --site=startling-chebakia-0ca7da
```

## What's Working Now
- **App Structure**: Single-page React app with state management
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with Kuk Sool Won colors (gold/red/black)
- **PWA**: Service worker and manifest configured
- **Build**: Vite build process working correctly

## After Successful Deployment
The app should display:
- **Header**: "Meridian Mastery" with gold gradient text
- **Logo**: MM emblem in gold circle
- **Buttons**: Start Session (gold), Flashcards/Body Map (red), Settings (gray)
- **Footer**: Traditional Korean/TCM principles attribution

## Next Steps After Deployment Works
1. Add React Router back for proper navigation
2. Implement flashcard functionality with pressure point data
3. Create interactive body map with 5 Elements color coding
4. Test PWA installation on mobile devices
